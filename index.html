               <p>So, who am I?</p>
                I'm Mark Raymond C. De Luna. As the calendar flipped to September 22, 2000, I began my journey into this world, and now, at 21 years old, I find myself nestled in the charming locale of Samat Bugallon, Pangasinan.

My family is my anchor, with two wonderful siblings, Janna Nicole and Prince Majan De Luna. Our parents, Elizabeth and Ronald De Luna, have nurtured a sense of togetherness that's central to who I am.

When I'm not in the company of my family, you'll likely find me immersed in the digital realm, conquering mythical worlds and competing in online PC games. The camaraderie of my virtual teammates and the thrill of competition keeps my spirit alive and engaged.

Yet, life isn't confined to screens and pixels. There's an adventurer in me that finds solace in the revving of engines and the open road. Hanging out with friends, be it on motorcycles or in cars, adds an exhilarating layer to my experiences, creating memories that color the chapters of my life.

As the pages of my life continue to turn, I'm thankful for every opportunity, every connection, and every moment that shapes me into who I am. So, there's much more to my story, and I'm excitedly embracing the unwritten chapters that lie ahead.
